PROJECT 1 :This paper addresses a real life problem with Fourier Transform. The noisy data from the ultrasound is given, the purpose is to locate the object after denoising.  The techniques used in this paper are denoising by averaging and filtering, specifically gaussian filter. It also involves visualization of the data. The programming software used is MATLAB. 
  
PROJECT 2 :This paper deals with one application of Gabor Transform. Given a music recording, I would use Gabor Transform to create a spectrogram for analyzation. I will also explore how the window width, oversampling, and types of function window affect the spectrogram. The programming software used is MATLAB.

PROJECT 3 :This paper involves the use of principal component analysis. The purpose is simply to do some experiment with PCA, and discover its practical usefulness and the effects of noise on the PCA algorithms. The programming software used is MATLAB.

PROJECT 4 :This paper addresses classifying a given piece of music by sampling a 5 second clip. The tools used in this paper are machine learning, linear discriminant analysis. The programming software used is MATLAB.

PROJECT 5 :The purpose of this paper is to train two neural networks that classifies the images in the Fashion-MINIST data set. There are 60000 training images in the array x_train_full and 10000 test images in the array x_test each of which is 28x28. The labels are contained in the vectors y_train_full and y_test. The values in the vectors are numbers from 0 to 9, and they correspond to the 10 classes in the following way. T-shirt/top corresponds to 0, trouser to 1, pullover to 2, dress to 3, coat to 4, sandal to 5, shirt to 6, sneaker to 7, bag to 8, ankle boot to 9
